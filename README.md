# DataCamp-Projects

DataCamp projects allow you to apply the skills you have learned in DataCamp courses. In each project, you will carry out an end-to-end analysis on real-world tasks using real-world tools and workflows. In doing so, you will learn how to work with Jupyter notebooks: an open-source web application that is great for interactive data analysis.

Solve real-world problems with guided and unguided projects.

Guided Projects
Follow step-by-step tasks to solve real-world problems. Youâ€™ll receive helpful feedback as you apply your new skills to reach the solution.

Unguided Projects
Solve open-ended data science problems without step-by-step tasks. If you get stuck, follow the live code-along video to see how our expert instructor finds one of the many possible solutions.
